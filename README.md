# VGW-Molecular
Variational Gaussian Wavepacket code for parallel, Monte-Carlo simulation of small molecular systems.

This is parallelizable scientific progamming code written in Fortran-90 for the simulation of atomic clusters and small molecular systems. Please see the included pdf file, 'VGW-Molecular.pdf' for an explaination of the thoery and how to implement and run. A make file is inluded and should compile and run on any linux/unix systems. A Fortran90 compiler is required as well as a verision of MPI. Please feel free to email me any questions or to offer suggestions at jason.deckman@gmail.com or through GitHub.
